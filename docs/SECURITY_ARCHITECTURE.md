## Security Components

### 1. Authentication Service

**Purpose**: Manages user authentication, MFA, and session handling

**Features**:
- OAuth 2.0 + JWT implementation
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Password policy enforcement
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Rate limiting for login attempts

**Configuration**:
```typescript
{
  jwt: {
    secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    expiresIn: '1h',
    refreshTokenExpiresIn: '7d',
    issuer: 'flowai-pipeline',
    audience: 'flowai-users'
  },
  mfa: {
    enabled: true,
    issuer: 'FlowAI',
    window: 2,
    backupCodesCount: 10
  },
  password: {
    minLength: 12,
    requireUppercase: true,
    requireLowercase: true,
    requireNumbers: true,
    requireSpecialChars: true
  }
}
```

### 2. Encryption Service

**Purpose**: Provides data encryption, key management, and cryptographic operations

**Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- Automatic key rotation
- Digital signatures
- HMAC operations
- Secure key storage

**Key Management**:
- Master keys encrypted with HSM
- Automatic rotation every 30 days
- Compromised key detection and revocation
- Secure key backup and recovery

### 3. Access Control Service

**Purpose**: Manages authorization, RBAC, and ABAC policies

**Features**:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Data classification system
- Permission inheritance
- Multi-tenant isolation

**Policy Example**:
```json
{
  "id": "admin-access",
  "name": "Administrator Access",
  "effect": "allow",
  "actions": ["read", "write", "delete"],
  "resources": ["admin/*"],
  "conditions": {
    "user.role": "admin",
    "user.mfaEnabled": true,
    "environment.time": {"$gte": "09:00", "$lte": "17:00"}
  },
  "priority": 100
}
```

### 4. Monitoring Service

**Purpose**: Security event logging, alerting, and incident response

**Features**:
- Real-time security event logging
- Automated alert generation
- Incident tracking and management
- Security metrics and reporting
- Log retention and compliance

**Alert Rules**:
- Brute force attack detection
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Data breach indicators
- System compromise detection

### 5. Network Security Service

**Purpose**: Network protection, TLS, and firewall management

**Features**:
- Mutual TLS authentication
- Network segmentation
- Firewall rule management
- Certificate pinning
- DDoS protection

## Security Layers

### 1. Perimeter Security
- Firewall with least privilege rules
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all traffic
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Network segmentation

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- API key authentication

### 3. Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- Data classification
- Secure key management
- Data loss prevention

### 4. Monitoring & Response
- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated alerting
- Incident response procedures
- Security analytics

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Authentication**
   - Use MFA for all accounts
   - Implement proper session timeout
   - Store passwords securely using bcrypt

3. **Authorization**
   - Check permissions for every operation
   - Use role-based access control
   - Implement least privilege principle

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use secure key management
   - Implement data classification

### For System Administrators

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Keep security configurations up to date
   - Regularly review access controls
   - Monitor system logs

2. **Incident Response**
   - Follow established incident response procedures
   - Maintain updated contact lists
   - Conduct regular security drills

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor security alerts regularly
   - Review access logs
   - Track security metrics

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- User consent management
- Data subject access requests
- Breach notification procedures

### SOC 2 Compliance
- Security controls documentation
- Access control procedures
- Monitoring and alerting
- Incident response processes

### ISO 27001 Compliance
- Information security management system
- Risk assessment procedures
- Security policy documentation
- Regular security audits

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for all security components
- Integration tests for security workflows
- Performance tests under security load
- Penetration testing framework

### Manual Testing
- Security code reviews
- Threat modeling exercises
- Incident response drills
- Security awareness training

## Incident Response

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts and manual detection
2. **Assessment**: Triage and impact assessment
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove root cause
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve
