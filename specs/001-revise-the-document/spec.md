# Feature Specification: Revise the Document

**Feature Branch**: `001-revise-the-document`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Revise the document to eliminate the verification stage from the pipeline process entirely. Strengthen the pipeline's security by incorporating advanced authentication protocols, data encryption, and access controls. Guarantee that the precise output from each prior stage is seamlessly and unalteredly forwarded to the following stage."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The system processes documents through a streamlined pipeline that eliminates manual verification while maintaining robust security and data integrity throughout the entire workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a document enters the pipeline, **When** it completes any processing stage, **Then** the exact output must be automatically forwarded to the next stage without any verification step
2. **Given** a document is being processed through the pipeline, **When** it moves between stages, **Then** all data must remain encrypted and unaltered during transit
3. **Given** a user or system attempts to access pipeline data, **When** authentication is required, **Then** advanced authentication protocols must validate the access request before granting permissions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a pipeline stage fails but the system attempts to forward output to the next stage?
- How does the system handle cases where authentication fails during pipeline execution?
- What occurs if data becomes corrupted during the forwarding process between stages?
- How are access controls enforced when multiple users interact with the same pipeline instance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST eliminate the verification stage from the pipeline process entirely
- **FR-002**: System MUST incorporate advanced authentication protocols for all pipeline access
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement data encryption for all information passing through the pipeline
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce access controls throughout the pipeline workflow
- **FR-005**: System MUST guarantee that output from each stage is forwarded unaltered to the subsequent stage
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain data integrity during all stage transitions
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure seamless forwarding of processing results between pipeline stages

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-008**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - multi-factor, biometric, token-based?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain pipeline data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific types of documents or data formats not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Pipeline Process**: A workflow that processes documents through sequential stages without manual verification
- **Document**: The data or content being processed through the pipeline stages
- **Stage Output**: The precise result generated by each pipeline stage that must be forwarded unaltered
- **Authentication Protocol**: The security mechanism that validates access to pipeline functions
- **Access Control**: The permissions and restrictions governing who can interact with pipeline data
