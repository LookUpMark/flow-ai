# Feature Specification: Divide the output panel in 2 panels vertically separated

**Feature Branch**: `003-divide-the-output`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Divide the output panel in 2 panels vertically separated, one with the input given for that specifical stage, and one with the output generated by that stage"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user working with the AI pipeline system, I want to see both the input provided to each stage and the output generated by that stage in a vertically divided panel, so that I can easily compare and understand the transformation that occurs at each step of the process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the output panel for any stage, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see two vertically separated panels - one showing the input data and one showing the output data
2. **Given** I have navigated to a specific stage in the pipeline, **When** I look at the output panel, **Then** the left panel should display the exact input that was provided to that stage
3. **Given** I am viewing a stage's output panel, **When** the stage has completed processing, **Then** the right panel should display the output generated by that stage
4. **Given** I am viewing the output panel, **When** I resize the browser window, **Then** both panels should maintain their vertical separation and remain readable

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the input data is very large (long text, large images)?
- How does the system handle when a stage produces no output?
- What occurs when the input panel is empty or contains only whitespace?
- How should the panels behave when the content doesn't fit in the available space?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the output panel as two vertically separated sections when viewing any stage
- **FR-002**: System MUST show the input provided to the current stage in the left/upper panel
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the output generated by the current stage in the right/lower panel
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain clear visual separation between input and output sections
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure both panels remain accessible and readable across different screen sizes
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the exact formatting and content of both input and output data

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Input Data**: The data provided to a specific stage, including text, parameters, and configuration
- **Output Data**: The result generated by a stage, which may include processed text, generated content, or transformed data
- **Stage Context**: Information about which stage is currently being viewed and its position in the pipeline
